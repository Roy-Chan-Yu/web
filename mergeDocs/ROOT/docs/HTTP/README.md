## Three important things about HTTP

1. Connectionless:

> the server `re-establish the connection again`and delivers the response to the client, after which the `client disconnects the connection.`

2. Media Independent

> HTTP is media independent.

3. Stateless

> If the connection is closed,   and two computers want to connect again, they need to provide information to each other anew, and the connection is handled as the very first one.
