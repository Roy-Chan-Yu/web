## Introduction to Log4j

- is a fast, reliable and <font color="red">flexible logging framework</font> which is written in java. It is an <font color="red">open-source logging API</font> for java.
- is a powerful aid for `understanding and debugging the runtime behavior of the programs`.
  
## Good logging requires three things:

- The log messages have to provide the required information to `understand what the application does internally`.
- `Writing log messages have to` be as efficient as possible so that it does `not affect the performance of your application`.
- You need to be able to adapt the logging details to different deployment environments and situations.

## Log AD

### Quick Debugging

- Well-planned and well-written logging code `reduces the overall cost of debugging` the application.

### Problem Diagnosis

- we will be able to detect the problems precisely and quickly.

### Easy Maintenance:

- useful logging feature is easy to debug, and therefore, it is easy to maintain.

### Cost and Time Savings

- Cost and Time Savings: Well-written logging code offers quick debugging and easy maintenance.

## Log DISAD

- Badly produced logging information can cause confusion.
- Logging with bad code can `seriously affect the application's performance`.

## Why use Log4j

- It is an open source.
With log4j, it is possible to store the flow details of our automation in a file or database.
Log4j is worked for large as well as small projects.
In log4j, we use log statements rather than SOPL statements in the code to know the condition of a project while it is executing.

## Log4J Features 

- It's `thread-safe`.
- It's `optimized for speed`.
- It's supports internationalization.
- It's `designed to manage Java exceptions` from the start.
- Behavior of logging can be set `at runtime using a configuration file`.
