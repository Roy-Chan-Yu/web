## SQL Injection

- The SQL Injection is a code penetration technique that might cause loss to our database.

> SQL injection generally occurs when we ask a user to input their username/userID

## Deal with Injection

- validate input from the user by pre-defining length, input type, and the input field.
- the user cannot be granted permission to access everything in the database.
- use system administrator accounts.
