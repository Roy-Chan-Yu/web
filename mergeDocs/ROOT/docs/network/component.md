## Computer Network Components

- NIC(network interface card)網卡
- Hub(集線器)
- Switch(交換器)
- Router(路由)
- Modem(數據機)
- Cables and Connectors(電纜線)
- MotherBoard(主機版)

## NIC

- NIC is a hardware component used to `connect a computer with another computer onto a network`.
- The MAC address or physical address is `encoded on the network card chip`which is assigned by the IEEE to `identify a network card uniquely`. The `MAC address is stored in the PROM` (Programmable read-only memory).

## Types of NIC

1. Wired NIC
   - is present `inside the motherboard`. |`Cables and connectors are used with wired NIC` to transfer data
2. Wireless NIC
   - The wireless NIC contains the antenna to obtain the connection over the wireless network..

## Hub

- divides the network connection among multiple devices
- Hub will `broadcast this request to the entire network`.
- Hub will broadcast this request to the entire network. All the devices will check whether the request belongs to them or not. If not, the request will be dropped.

## Switch

- connects multiple devices on a computer network
- does `not broadcast the message to the entire network like the Hub`. we can say that switch `provides a direct connection between the source and destination.` It `increases the speed of the network`.

## Router

- is `used to connect a LAN`with an internet connection.used to `receive, analyze and forward the incoming packets to another network`.
- works in Lay3(network Layer) of the OSI Model.
- router forwards the pack based on available routing table.
- determines the best path from the paths for the transmission of the packet.

## AD of Router

- Security
- Reliability
- Performance
- Network range

## Security

- the package is transmitted to the network which will `traverse the entire cable`,But the `only specified device which has been addressed can read` the data.

## Reliabilty

- If the server has stopped function,network goes down, but `no other networks are affected that are served by the router.`.(find the properly route table.)

## Performance

- Router `enhances the overall performance of the networks`.Router split the network into two part of workstations.`It Reduces the traffic load by half`.

## Modem

- A modem is a hardware device that allows the computer to connect to the internet over the existing telephone line.
- it's installed on the PCI slot found on the motherboard.
- Modulator/Demodulator(調變器) `converts the digital data into an alalog signal` over the telephone lines.

1. Standard PC modem or Dial-up modem
2. Cellular Modem
3. Cable modem

## Cables and Connectors

- Cable is a transmission media used for transmitting a signal.
  
1. Twisted pair cable(雙絞線)
2. Coaxial cable(同軸電纜)
3. Fibre-optic cabel(光纖)
