## Topology

- the structure of the network of `how all the components are interconnected` to each other.

## Physical Topology

- Bus
- Ring
- Tree
- Star
- Mesh

## 1. Bus
  
- The bus topology is designed in such a way that `all the stations are connected through a single cable` known as a backbone cable.(骨幹拓樸)

### CSMA

> The most common access method of the bus topologies is CSMA

### CSMA CD(Collision Detection)

> is an access method used to detect the collision. It's works on `recovery after the collision.`

### CSMA/CA(Collision Avoidance)

> `checking whether the transmission media is busy or not`.If busy, then the sender waits `until the media becomes idle`.It's not working in `recovery after the collision`.
